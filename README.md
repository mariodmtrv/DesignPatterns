DesignPatterns
==============

Nothing to see here. Just my design patterns training stubs

<h2> Implemented patterns </h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h3>Strategy</h3>
    <p>
      Defines a family of algorithms,
      encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
      Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3> Observer </h3>
    <p>
      Defines a one-to-many dependency so that when a subject 
      changes state all its dependent observers are notified
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
